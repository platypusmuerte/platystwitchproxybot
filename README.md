# Platys Twitch Proxy Bot

The purpose of this bot, is to relay or forward events and messages from Twitch endpoints to stream bots that were made for Mixer.

```
This bot is serving a short-term need and is in early stages. You may very well encounter bugs. 
It would be most awesome of you to let me know about them. 
(also if it doesn't break, that would be cool to hear about too)
```

## Why?

Because, awesome tools like [MixItUp](https://mixitupapp.com/) and [Firebot](https://crowbartools.com/tools/firebot/) do not exist for Twitch yet.

## Features

Currently, Platys Twitch Proxy Bot only works with Mix It Up. I have plans to add Firebot as soon as I can.

- Map Twitch events to commands in Mix It up
	- ex: follows, hosts, raids, channel points, subs, bit events, etc
- Auto shout out viewers based off roles/ranks
	- Follower, VIP, Founder, Sub, Mod, Premium, etc
- Parse chat messages
	- Use 'starts with' or 'match' to trigger commands from text in chat messages.
	- ex: trigger phrase "moo" could be used to match a command, when a user says "That was smooth" in chat
